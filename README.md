# MSCI 342 - Sprint 1

## Due: February 24th, 6:00PM

## Project Description:
The proposed system, named MedSync, solves the issue of fragmented medical information by creating a centralized platform for patients and doctors. Medical data, such as blood test results, appointment bookings, and patient-specialist matching, remains scattered across systems without proper integration. This fragmentation creates challenges for patients accessing records and doctors managing schedules or patient interactions.

The system includes two distinct sections, one for patients and another for hospital staff. Patients gain secure access to view medical records, book appointments, and review test results. Doctors organize schedules, access patient information, and communicate with colleagues using features designed for their workflow. The design ensures practicality, enhancing medical processes rather than replacing them.
